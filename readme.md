##Classes
You'll need to use babel to run this code in the console
You probably already have it installed from class so just cd into this folder in your terminal and run `babel .`

We've made a Grub class for you already using traditional ES5 Construction

Create an ES6 style class for Bee and then the GiantBee class
(more description in js file)

##Graph
Start by copying in your Bee and GiantBee constructors (the Grub constructor is alread).

Some of the graph functions are filled in, others you will need to add.

Your big taks is to create a graph that has bees as nodes, and builds connections based on properties of the bee objects.

The way this implementation of graphs is built, you need to pass in a primitive value as the value for each node. You will see the Grub constructor has an id property that starts at 0 and increments every time you build a Grub, Bee or GiantBee.

You will use the id property of each bee when you add it to the graph.

Use the visualize function to test if your graph is built correctly.

##Tree
Build a tree that represents the rock, paper, permutations problem.

The tree functions are done, you need to fill in the RPS function and add the game possibilities to a tree

You should be able to do this in just a few lines of code
